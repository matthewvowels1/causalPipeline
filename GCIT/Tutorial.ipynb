    "Conditional independence tests are concerned with the question of whether two variables $X$ and $Y$ behave independently of each other, after accounting for the effect of confounders $Z$. Such questions can be written as a hypothesis testing problem: $\\mathcal H_0: X\\indep Y|Z $ versus the general alternative of no independence. A conditional independence test, given a significance level, determines whether to reject or not the null hypothesis $\\mathcal H_0$."

    "Our test is based on a modification of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that simulates from a distribution under the assumption of conditional independence, while maintaining good power in high dimensional data. In our procedure, after training, the first step involves simulating from our network to generate data sets consistent with $\\mathcal H_0$. We then define a test statistic to capture the $X-Y$ dependency in each sample and compute an empirical distribution which approximates the behaviour of the statistic under $\\mathcal H_0$ and can be directly compared to the statistic observed on the real data to make a decision.
